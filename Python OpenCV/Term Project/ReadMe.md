# Image Filtering App

This is a PyQt-based application that allows users to load an image, apply various filters to it, and save the filtered image. The application provides a user-friendly interface to select different filters and visualize the original and filtered images.

## Features
Load an image from the file system.

Apply filters such as:
grayscale, 
blur, 
edge detection, 
sepia, 
invert colors, 
sharpen, 
emboss, 
brightness, 
contrast, 
custom filter 1, and custom filter 2

View the original and filtered images side by side
Save the filtered image to a file

### Prerequisites
Python 3
PyQt5
OpenCV
NumPy

The application window will appear, providing the following functionality:

### Load Image: 
Click this button to open a file dialog and select an image file to load.
### Filter: 
Choose a filter from the drop-down list to apply to the loaded image.
### Apply Filter: 
Click this button to apply the selected filter to the original image and display the filtered image.
### Save Image: 
After applying a filter, click this button to save the filtered image to a file.
### Custom Filters
The application includes two custom filters that you can modify to implement your own image processing logic:
Run the app.py file to start the application.
Click on the "Load Image" button to select an image file from your computer.
Choose a filter option from the dropdown menu.
Click on the "Apply Filter" button to apply the selected filter to the image.
The original image and the filtered image will be displayed side by side.



## The following filters are available in the app:

Grayscale: Converts the image to grayscale.
Blur: Applies Gaussian blur to the image.
Edge Detection: Detects edges in the image using the Canny edge detection algorithm.
Sepia: Applies a sepia tone effect to the image.
Invert Colors: Inverts the colors of the image.
Sharpen: Enhances the sharpness of the image.
Emboss: Adds an embossed effect to the image.
Brightness: Adjusts the brightness of the image.
Contrast: Adjusts the contrast of the image.
