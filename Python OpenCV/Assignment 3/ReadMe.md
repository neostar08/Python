Camera calibration is the process of determining the camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. The intrinsic parameters include the focal length, optical center, and lens distortion, while the extrinsic parameters represent the camera's position and orientation in 3D space.

To calibrate your camera using the chessboard pattern, you can follow these steps:

1. Print a chessboard pattern on an A4 paper. You can find chessboard patterns online, such as the OpenCV chessboard collection.

2. Capture a video of the chessboard from various viewpoints using your laptop or smartphone. Make sure the chessboard is fully visible in each frame and that it covers different orientations and distances.

3. Use the example code provided in the file "camera_calibration.py" to calibrate your camera. This code uses OpenCV's camera calibration functions. It will detect the corners of the chessboard in each frame, and based on these corner points, it will estimate the camera's intrinsic and distortion parameters.

4. After running the calibration code, it will provide you with the calibration results, including the camera matrix (K) and distortion coefficients (dist_coeff).

For testing PnP (Perspective-n-Point) and AR (Augmented Reality) using the chessboard, you can follow these steps:

1. Use the example code "pose_estimation_chessboard.py" provided to estimate the pose (position and orientation) of the chessboard in the camera frame. This code uses PnP algorithms to estimate the camera pose based on the known 3D structure of the chessboard and its 2D image points.

2. Modify the AR part of the code to add your favorite number, character, or any other object as an overlay on the chessboard. You can use libraries like OpenCV or Pygame to add the overlay.

3. Run the modified code to visualize the augmented reality result, where the added object appears to be placed on top of the chessboard.
